Ans ->  So basically, In web development, backend refers to the server-side application or website to handle the application logic mamange database interaction,
        user authentication and processes client requests, ultimately returning the appropriate responses.

Understanding the backend part the i have learned about basic express.js and mongoDB like how to create a express file 

# setup of Express.js -> I have 4 simple step to follow and install the server side 
STEP 1 : create a folder 
STEP 2 : use command (npm init -y)
STEP 3 : npm i express
STEP 4 : Run in terminal -> node <folder_name>.js
